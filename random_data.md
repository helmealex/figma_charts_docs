There are a few options available to be configured for the random data:
+ **Count** - represents the number of datasets
+ **Length** - represents the length of each dataset
+ **Min Value** - represents the lower point of the interval in which data points are generated
+ **Max Value** - represents the upper point of the interval in which data points are generated
